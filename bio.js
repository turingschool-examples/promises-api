    bio: 'Before Turing, Travis worked as a junior engineer at Spruce Labs where he was responsible for software scalability, development architecture, dependency management, and cross-browser compatibility issues. Whether it is streamlining a process for a user or giving a user the ability to do something they have never had access to, Travis believes programming is made by people for the people. He loves solving problems and creating experiences that provide a better experience for others, and as a result, programming was a natural fit for him. He hopes that his skills in team building, organization, and software development will help teach and build the community at Turing. When he is not at Turing, he enjoys producing hip-hop beats, eating great food, and playing video games.',
